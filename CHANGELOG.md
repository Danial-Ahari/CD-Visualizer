### Original Code

This code was essentially just a very basic front end for the EDC/ECC checker.

### June 29th - 12:45

A lot of changes made today. Mostly knocking items off the to-do list, and making the program more usable.

### July 3rd - 15:00

Better interface, more usable, total number of errors, sectors, and error rate, BMP creation (no exporting yet). Multiple instances can run at the same time. Absolute paths are supported.

### July 5th - 15:00

Better interface again, more usable again, now can export images. Updated README as well with mention of requirements for the GTK interface.
